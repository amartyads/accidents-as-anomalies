This code was written to work with the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales

The work was done using the Spyder editor for Python, hence the code is broken into cells which are individually runnable.

Details of the work can be found in 'datavis report.pdf' and 'experiment report.pdf'. They can also serve as an introduction for the datasets.

Raw latex files are in the datavis graphs folder.

The code includes temporary programs and test code, left here for completion's sake.

Please download the dataset from the aforementioned link, and paste into the dataset folder.
