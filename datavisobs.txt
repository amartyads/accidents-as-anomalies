Fatal casualties are the worst, followed by severe and light in that order

*_Day of Week_*
More fatal casualties on the weekends, more slight casualties on the weekdays, more severe casualties on Friday and Saturday


*_Light Conditions_*
Most fatal casualties occured in daylight on roads with streetlights (~59%), followed by nighttime and no street lights (~20%) and then nighttime and lit streetlights(~19%)

Most severe casualties again in daylight (~67%), followed by streetlights being present and lit (~21%) and then darkness without streetlights (~10%)

~73% of all slight accidents occur in daylight. Next biggest chunk is ~19% for streetlights present and lit.


*_Weather Conditions_*
81.7% of all fatal casualties occur in fine weather without high winds, followed by ~10% in raining without high winds. Data is almost identical for severe and slight casualties.


*_Road Conditions_*
~65% of all fatal casualties occur on dry roads, and 32.5% on wet/damp roads. Again, data is almost identical for severe (68.5%, 29%) and slight (67.8%, 29%) casualties.


*_Urban or Rural Area_*
Of all fatal casualties, ~29.5% were in urban areas, while ~70.5% were in rural areas.

The statistics flip for severe and slight accidents. Severe casualties were almost identical (~52% urban, ~48% rural) and for slight casualties, urban (~63.5%) had more than rural (~36.5).


*_Monthwise analysis_*
Provides no significant insight, numbers consistent amongst months except for February


*_Hourly analysis_*
_Weekdays:_ Fatal casualty numbers go up gradually from 04:00 (285), peaking at 17:00 to 17:59 (1662), then tapering off.

Severe casualties follow a similar pattern but there is an abrupt spike at 08:00 to 08:59 (14021). Following this the number goes down to 8758 at 09:00, and increases gradually before rising abruptly from 15:00 to 17:59 (changing from 11798 to 16249 and above) before going back down.

Slight casualties follow a similar pattern, with spikes at 08:00-08:59 and 15:00-17:59.

_Weekends:_ Fatal casualities follow a smooth pattern, with spikes at 17:00-17:59 and 00:00-02:59. minimum values occur at 06:00 and 22:00.

Severe and slight casualty numbers follow almost identical trends.


*_Speed Limits_*
Speed limits in the data vary from 10 to 70 mph.

Fatal casualties occur mostly at the higher speed limit areas (60 mph: ~43%, 70 mph: ~15.2%). ~27% of fatal casualties occur at 30 mph speed limit areas.

Most severe casualties occur in areas with speed limit 30 mph (~52.3%), followed by 60 mph(~26%).

Similarly, most slight accidents occur in areas with speed limit 30 mph (~62.6%), followed by 60 mph(~16%).

*_Road Type_*
~75.8% of fatal casualties occured on single carriageways, followed by ~21% on dual carriageways.

Similar trends are seen for severe (~79% single carriageway, ~14.6% dual carriageway) and slight (~73% single carriageway, ~16.3% dual carriageway) casualties.
